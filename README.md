Brick Breaker game consists of bricks aligned at the top of the screen. The player is represented as a tiny ball that is placed on a small platform at the bottom of the screen. The platform can be moved around from left to right on the screen with the help of arrow keys on the keyboard. The player uses the platform to keep the ball running. The goal is to break the bricks without missing the ball with your platform.
